# Zenith

**Zenith** (Zero-Effort Interpreter for Teaching and Hacking) is a simple interpreter for a made-up programming language, written in Java. This project aims to provide a basic understanding of interpreter design and implementation, making it a great educational resource for those interested in language development.

## Progress

- [x] Lexer: The lexer is responsible for tokenizing the source code.
- [x] Token Types: We've defined various token types for the language.
- [x] Error Handling: Basic error handling for unexpected characters.
- [x] Basic Language Features: Support for comments, numbers, strings, and identifiers.

## Getting Started

To run the Zenith interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the Java code using `javac`.

## Future Plans
- **Parser**: Implement a parser to build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- **Execution**: Execute the code represented by the AST.
- **Functions**: Add support for user-defined functions.
- **Control Flow**: Implement conditional statements and loops.
- **Standard Library**: Create a standard library for Zenith.
